# Impacts on Society

This will be an opening unit to a longer introductory enrichment course for computer science designed for 7th-10th graders. The course will be called *Computers and You*. Students will explore how computers impact their day to day lives and will also begin to learn some coding fundamentals with a culminating activity develping an app connected to a service learning project benefiting their immediate community in some way. This particular unit will provide a learning experience designed to set the stage for an understanding of the tremendous postive and negative ways computers imapct our society and will serve as a means to estabalish an awareness to guide students' thinking in all projects connected to the larger class.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

- A broad knowledge and understanding of the role of computing in society
- Awareness of pressing social and ethical questions arising in response to computing 
- Consideration of the responsibilities of computing professionals
- Development of group work, collaborative and presentation skills

### Learning Activities
Students will form small groups of no larger than 4 members and choose a focus question from the list below. If multiple groups want the same topic we will have a randomized way to make sure all topics are covered and choices are made equitably.
- How have computers made your life easier?
- How have computers supported or been an amplification of free speech?
- How have computers made controlling access to and maintaining the privacy of our data harder?
- How have computers changed business?
- How have computers changed education?
- How have computers been used to solve real world problems?
- Who is working in the computer science industry and who has ready access?
- What are some issues computers have created in our society?

After group and focus questions have been selected students will begin to select roles within their groups to help focus responsibilty and collectively research the given topic. Teacher provided guiding questions and resources for each topic will aid students in critiquing and evaluating their research findings. These guiding questions will in part include questions regarding issues surrounding diversity, equity and ways to make computer science more inclusive for all people. The culmination of their research will be a presentation to the whole class in which they share their findings and the conclusions they have made. Students will have choice in how they present but all will have a common rubric to guide the quality of the presentation. Part of their presentaion will include analysis, evaluation and some possible solutions or suggestions the group will create based on their research. Audience memebers will need to take notes and answer guiding questions created by the presenting group to ensure attention and consideration is made for all presenations. Students wil then write a reflective piece in which they explore their own new awareness of issues raised by computers. These issues and questions will be used throughout the enrichement course as a touchpoint to guide the decisions students make in later projects.


### Assessment

Students' progress will be evaluated throughout the project via group meetings with the teacher as a progress check. In addition, individual members will both evaluate themselves and their group memebers via pre-established groupwork rubrics at the end of the project. The presenations will be evaluated with a rubric by the teacher and by the audience members as well.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
This project will facilitate a broader awareness of the need for a greater degree of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the computer science field at large because students will be exposed to the facts concerning the lack of diversity within the field and how that can influence various outcomes. In addition, as students explore the issues within not only the U.S., but also worldwide, the lack of equiatble access and the impacts thereof will become more clear. Part of the students' reflective writing piece will also include addressing these issues. As students continue in the course after this unit we will refer back tho findings to help ensure that the students' conclusions continue to help inform their decisions in later projects. For the long term the hope is that this new awareness will help them in the future make more equitable personal choices as well as inspire them to be a part of this industry as a voice for those often left out.
